# CPSC 5330: Assignment 1
This is the first assignment of CPSC 5330: Mobile Applications Development 1. The goal of the assignment was to create a single view app on Xcode and to add an image set, image view, and label to the application.
## My Application
For my application I chose to use a photo of the Brisbane Broncos rugby team. When running the app, you can see the color matched background, as well as the color matched font below the image.
